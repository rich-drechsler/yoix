Classes in this directory are used by the Yoix compiler when it constructs
Java class files, however the important classes in this package don't even
reference the Yoix interpreter, so it's pretty much a stand-alone collection
that can be adapted to other tasks. If you want to move the source somewhere
else all you should have to do is change the package name in the source files.

Methods in JVMAssembler.java translate instructions in an "expanded assembly
language" into files that can be loaded by the Java Virtual Machine, which is
described in

    http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/VMSpecTOC.doc.html

Right now our "expanded assembly language" is undocumented, but we hope that
will eventually change. The examples in the Tests directory won't work outside
the Yoix interpreter, but they should give you an idea of what the syntax is
(see Tests/README for more details). You can also view the assembly language
that's generated by the Yoix interpreter when it compiles a function or script
by setting various debug flags, so take a look at the Compiler reference page
that's included in the current Yoix release.
