Many of these tests are old and may not work with the current
version. The group that I've recently used are

	test5.yx
	test10.yx
	test13.yx
	test15.yx
	test17.yx
	test18.yx
	test19.yx
	test20.yx	4/19 addition for call test

so there's a good chance they still work. Several of the test
files also dump a class file in /tmp/xxx. You can test them
using

	cp /tmp/xxx ZZZ.class
	java ZZZ

and in most cases something should print on stdout.

To dump an existing Java class file start the Yoix interpreter
in the parent of this directory by typing something like

    make JAVAFLAGS='-mx512m' RUNARGS='-D21' run

and the type

    import yoix.*.*;
    import yoix.module.att.research.yoix.jvma.JVMTestModule.*;

    loadClassFile("../YoixBodyThread.class");
    printf("%s", dumpClassFile());

and a dump of the class file that you pointed at should print
on stdout. JVMTestModule.java isn't mentioned in the Makefile,
so you probably may have to compile it by hand before you use
it in a Yoix script.

NOTE - by default JVMTestModule.class isn't built by the jvma
Makefile, so you have to build it on your own before running
any of the test files. For example, if you're currently in the
same directory as this file then

    cd ..
    make JVMTestModule.class

should compile JVMTestModule.java.
