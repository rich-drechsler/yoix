//
// Simple test of the new fullscreen field that was added to Swing and AWT
// windows, frames, and dialogs. Frame decorations seem to be a small issue
// on Linux, but maybe not on other platforms, so that's something we should
// investigate. The example uses JFrames, the decorationstyle field, which
// should be 0, 1, or 2, and the VM.screen.fullscreensupported field to pick
// a frame decorationstyle.
//
// NOTE - Java documentation suggests calling
//
//     Component.enableInputMethods(false);
//
// when full screen windows are created, probably to make it harder to steal
// keystrokes, but right now we don't do it. Might be something to consider
// before the next release, but it might also be really inconvenient - they
// obviously decided not to do it. See
//
//     http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/extra/fullscreen/
//
// for more info.
