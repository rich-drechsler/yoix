//
// This example shows how the panandzoom flags of a JCanvas are used. The
// first 8 bits control panning, the next 8 bits control zooming, and the
// last 8 bits let you select mouse buttons and modifiers that restore the
// canvas to its default state. its that reference mouse buttons mean any
// one of the selected buttons can be used to start the operation, but only
// if all the modifier keys selected by the appropriate modifier bits are
// down when the button is pressed.
//
//	Pan control bits:
//	    bit 0 - mouse button 1 can be used to start panning
//	    bit 1 - mouse button 2 can be used to start panning
//	    bit 2 - mouse button 3 can be used to start panning
//	    bit 3 - unused
//	    bit 4 - SHIFT key must be held to start panning
//	    bit 5 - CTRL key must be held to start panning
//	    bit 6 - ALT key must be held to start panning
//	    bit 7 - pan using copyarea otherwise full repaint
//
//	Zoom control bits:
//	    bit 8  - unused
//	    bit 9  - unused
//	    bit 10 - unused
//	    bit 11 - enable mouse wheel zooming
//	    bit 12 - SHIFT key must be held to start zooming
//	    bit 13 - CTRL key must be held to start zooming
//	    bit 14 - ATL key must be held to start zooming
//	    bit 15 - unused
//
//	Reset control bits:
//	    bit 16 - mouse button 1 can be used for reset
//	    bit 17 - mouse button 2 can be used for reset
//	    bit 18 - mouse button 3 can be used for reset
//	    bit 19 - unused
//	    bit 20 - SHIFT key must be held to trigger reset
//	    bit 21 - CTRL key must be held to trigger reset
//	    bit 22 - ALT key must be held to trigger reset
//	    bit 23 - unused
//
// Reset control restores the default matrix for the canvas. It's sometimes
// convenient, but isn't always appropriate (e.g., the matrix was scaled or
// translated before the initial paint), so in many cases you'll use an event
// handler attached to a component, like a JButton, to handle resets.
//
// When bit 7 is set automatic panning tries to use copyarea to update the
// canvas, otherwise a full repaint of the canvas is always used. Only set
// this bit if the paint() function defined in the canvas is smart and uses
// the clipping rectangle passed as an argument to reduce its workload because
// each copyarea usually generates two paint() calls (to refresh the two small
// rectangles uncovered by copyarea).
//
// Resetting restores the default matrix for the canvas. It's occasionally
// convenient, but isn't always the right approach (e.g., the matrix was
// scaled or translated before the initial paint), so in many cases you'll
// use an event handler attached to a component, like a JButton to handle,
// resets (as we do in this example).
