To build this you currently have to point at Java's jnlp.jar file. Take a
look at jnlp.mk for more information. Decided not to include this in the
default Yoix jar file because the status of JNLP in various versions of
Java isn't clear to me and I don't currently have time to investigate.

Added a few things to Module.java.test file, but didn't test much. Also not
convinced the additions are really worth it. Eventually should take another
look.
