Data files that have names that match up with the corresponding config files
that can found in directory

        ../scripts

are automatically run by the ydat bash script when the -c command line option
names that config file and there's no data file argument.

NOTE - reorganized this stuff on 5/23/20, and that means the old installer.yx
script probably won't work without appropriate changes. Not a big deal because
we currently have no plans to distribute this stuff using the Yoix installer.
