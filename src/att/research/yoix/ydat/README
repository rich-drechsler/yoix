You can run a new YDAT application that's under development using source code
that's stored somewhere under this directory by typing something like,

    make JAVAFLAGS="-mx512m" RUNARGS="scripts/public/ydat.yx -Hscripts/public -p -cpandemic data/public/pandemic.data" run

and if you're lucky the data windows (or an error message) should pop up on
your monitor.

Compiling the Java code will only work if your system has an appropriate JDK
and other obscure tools (e.g., javacc) installed. If not the build triggered
by the make call will fail and your only alternative is to use an existing
Yoix jar file. I'm doing it all here because I anticipate issues and/or new
features that might require Java code changes or additions.
