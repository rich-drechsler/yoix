Any makefiles in this directory are designed to be included by most of the
makefiles in the source package that do the real work. In the past we tried
to write makefiles that worked properly with different versions of make
(there were lots of them), but today just targeting GNU make is more sensible,
so we've dropped the portability goal and now assume GNU make is available on
your system.
