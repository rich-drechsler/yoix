These are very important files that are included by the makefiles in this
source package that do the real work. In most cases variables.mk will be
the only file in this directory you need to change.

    common.mk
	A file that's included by almost every low level Makefile
	in the YWAIT source package. It's really only two lines that
	include variables.mk and rules.mk.

    gsubsti.mk
	A simple makefile that defines the sed script that's used to
	stream edit ../scripts/gsubsti._YX.

    rules.mk
	This is where you'll find definitions for targets (e.g., all
	install, clean and clobber) that the low level Makefiles use.
	Inference rules defined near the end of this file control the
	preprocessing of source files marked by the special suffixes
	that are also defined in this file.

    variables.mk
	If you're lucky this will be the only YWAIT source file that
	you have to change. It's where important makefile variables
	are initialized with values that were selected when you (or
	someone on your behalf) ran the YWAIT configuration program.
	It's a file that's supposed to be included, either directly
	or indirectly, by every Makefile in this package.
