These are special Perl subroutines that are used by the Perl scripts

	../bin/ywait_exec._PL
	../bin/ywait_login._PL

and also by

	../bin/ywait_subtester._PL

which is a script that we occasionally use when we want to test a new
subroutine. They're automatically loaded by the Perl scripts, but only
when they're really needed. You'll find some magic Perl code that looks
something like,

	foreach $TMPTXT (qw(
		access
		changepassword
		checkid
		cleanuser
		getfile
		getprefs
		logout
		saveprefs
		sendmessage
		serverdemo
		welcome
	    )) {
	    eval "sub $TMPTXT {
		require \"$SUBSDIR/<_ACRONYM_LOWER_DQ_>_$TMPTXT.pl\";
		peer_$TMPTXT(\@_);
	    }";
	}

in the Perl scripts that use these subroutines. The ones listed are the
subroutines that will be loaded "on-demand", so if you write your own
make sure you add them to the list in the appropriate Perl script and
to the SOURCE list in ./Makefile. Also remember these subroutines are
loaded by Perl scripts that also include

	../etc/ywait_rc._PL

which means can use anything (e.g., WriteHeader(), WriteLog()) defined
in that file.
