#!<_PERL_PATH_> -w
#
# A script that can be called from programs, like shell scripts, that need
# to output a header but can't read Perl. Mostly designed to help convert
# an old application that was shell script based to YWAIT, which uses Perl
# for the main server-side scripts.
#
# NOTE - the official setup script exports WARNINGMESSAGE, but some shells
# don't give us changes back when we read $ENV{WARNINGMESSAGE} unless the
# script officially exports WARNINGMESSAGE. Looks like ksh and bash do, but
# /bin/sh on Solaris doesn't. Not a bog problem, but it is something that
# you should keep in mind.
