This is a Yoix script that's used to stream edit some source files before
they're actually installed. In general, files that end in suffixes ._HTML,
._JAVA, ._PL, ._TXT, and ._YX and need special preprocessing by gsubsti.yx
before they're ready to be read, compiled, or executed. The exception is
gsubsti._YX, which is translated into gsubsti.yx by a sed script that's
defined in ../make/gsubsti.mk.

Inference rules that are defined near the end of ../make/rules.mk control
the preprocessing, so that's were to look if you want to find the command
line that's used to execute gsubsti.yx. It's also where you'll find the
complete list of suffixes that we use to mark the source files that need
special preprocessing.
