Some useful administrative scripts

    broadcast._PL
	A simple script that you can use to manage broadcast messages that
	are sent back to clients when they contact your server. Messages
	and other control information are automatically saved in directory
	../broadcast. For example,

		./broadcast.pl /tmp/xxx

	copies the contents of /tmp/xxx to file ../broadcast/message and
	uses it as the message that's delivered to users when they connect
	to your server. The list of users that have seen the message are
	recorded in ../broadcast/log, so they don't get it more than once
	per login.  Typing

		./broadcast.pl -c

	cancels the current broadcast message. Comments in broadcast._PL
	provide more details.

    cleanup._PL
	A script normally run by cron that can be used to clean log files,
	home directories, tmp files, and the passwd file. Type

		./crontab.pl

	and suggestions for your crontab file that use cleanup.pl will be
	written to standard output.

    crontab._PL
	A script that writes possible crontab entries for your system on
	standard output. Your existing crontab entries are included in the
	output, but you should check for yourself too.

    makepassword._PL
	A script that takes a password and encrypts it so it can be used
	in the passwd file. Written a long time ago and is really no longer
	needed, because the the perl script that manages the passwd file
	now automatically adds (i.e., appends an updated entry) an entry
	with an encrypted password whenever a user logs in and the user's
	last entry user has a password field that's empty.

    utime._PL
	A script that's currently only used by the cleanup.pl.
