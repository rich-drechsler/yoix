The server and ../bin/broadcast.pl use this directory to manage broadcast
messages. A file named message in this directory (that's also readable by
the cgi scripts) is the broadcast message. Users who have seen the message
are recorded a file named log so they only get it once per login session.
Broadcast messages and logs are appended to messages.old and logs.old when
a broadcast message is officially canceled using

	../bin/broadcast.pl -c

which means you can keep a record of your broadcast messages and the users
who actually saw them.
