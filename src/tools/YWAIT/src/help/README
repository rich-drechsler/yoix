Files that are displayed by the YWAIT help system. Simple HTML is convenient
and it's what we use for the default help files, but the screen that's used
to display them won't object if they're plain text files.

Don't get too fancy if you add HTML files, because they're displayed by Java
component (a JTextPane) that doesn't handle everything.
