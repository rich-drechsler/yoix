<P>
Various application parameters are available for modification to
customize the application to your tastes. Select the
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>File =&gt; Preferences</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
menu item. A tree of parameters and parameter folders will appear.
Click on tree node to either expand it, if it is a folder, or edit
the current value, if it is a parameter.
<P>
You can either apply your changes immediately to the current session,
which also saves your choices on the application server or you can
request just a server save so that the changes will be available
the next time you log into <B><_ACRONYM_HTML_></B>.
<P>
Options under the <B>Edit</B> menu in the
preferences window allow you to expend or collapse the entire tree.
There are also several reset options that
allow you to reset a selected preference or all preferences back to the application defaults
or the previously saved values.
Incidentally, note that your personal preference settings are not
accessed until after successfully logging into the system.  Thus,
do not be surprised if the login screen does not reflect your
preference choices.
