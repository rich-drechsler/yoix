<P>
When <B><_ACRONYM_HTML_></B> offers a 'Print' option, it accomplishes the
printing in an indirect manner.  It stores the material to be printed
in a temporary file of an appropriate type (e.g., text, html or a
spreadsheet format) and asks the operating system to start up the
appropriate viewer program (e.g., a text editor, a web browser or
Microsoft Excel). On Microsoft or Apple platform the particular
viewer that is started depends on the file type configuration set-up
by the user (e.g., .htm -> web browser), while on Linux machines a
web browser is used as a general tool for handling the job. <B><_ACRONYM_HTML_></B>
attempts to guess the most appropriate platform-specific viewer
command, but users can supply a specific choice my means of the
<B>PREFERENCES:GENERAL:VIEWER</B> entry.
<P>
The reason for this indirect approach is that targeting data to be
printed to the most appropriate viewer tool provides more versatile
and sophisticated printing options than <B><_ACRONYM_HTML_></B> could hope to
provide by re-inventing the wheel. Moreover, since these viewers
are starting from raw data rather than a formatted print file (e.g,
a PDF file), this indirect approach also gives users the option of
saving the source data.
