An important new Perl script that handles "setup" queries from clients plus
two small shell scripts that serve as the YWAIT cgi scripts that handle login
and command execution. The shell scripts get a chance to set resource limits
before they call small C programs, which are sometimes installed setuid and
setgid, and it's those C programs that execute the Perl scripts that do the
real work.

    ywait_exec._SH
	Sets resource limits and then calls the installed version of
	../bin/ywait_exec._PL to handle the real work. Using a shell
	script here makes it easy to do other things, like redirect
	stderr to a file, when you're debugging the Perl script. If
	you want you can replace this script with a program written
	in any other language, just make sure the installed version
	of that program ends in the .cgi suffix.

    ywait_login._SH
	Sets resource limits and then calls the installed version of
	../bin/ywait_login._PL to handle the real work. Using a shell
	script here makes it easy to do other things, like redirect
	stderr to a file, when you're debugging the Perl script. If
	you want you can replace this script with a program written
	in any other language, just make sure the installed version
	of that program ends in the .cgi suffix.

    ywait_setup._PL
	This script handles the requests that come from the new YWAIT
	client that's responsible for finding the application's jar
	file and startup script. It's a script that's designed to be
	customized, particulary by YWAIT applications that may need
	to run separate test and production applications. The default
	implementation works with the Java client that's installed on
	user systems, but if you're running a production YWAIT system
	we recommend that you take a careful look at this script. If
	you're really curious you undoubtedly will also want to read
	the client Java code, which can be found in the file

	    ../jars/Ywait_Client._JAVA

	in the YWAIT source package.
