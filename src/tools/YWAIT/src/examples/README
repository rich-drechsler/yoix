A miscellaneous collection of example screens that are used by the the main
application screen that that YWAIT generates. The Makefile in this directory
is also a pretty good one to copy if you're adding new source directories.
Also notice that the INSTALLDIR definition in Makefile determines where the
files are installed. In other words, the name of the source directory has
nothing to do with where the files are installed.

The "server" examples include lots of comments and are really "hooked" up to
the main Perl script (i.e., ../bin/ywait_exec._PL). They're definitely worth
a close look when you're ready to start building screens that really talk to
your server.
